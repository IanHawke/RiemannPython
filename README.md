RiemannPython
=============

Illustrating how to solve the Riemann problem for hyperbolic conservation laws.

This will be a set of IPython notebooks based around David Ketcheson's [HyperPython](https://github.com/ketch/HyperPython) course, which itself derives a lot of material from Lorena Barba's [CFDPython](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython).

As the material is so heavily based on Ketcheson's course, the software requirements are similar:

- Python >= 2.7
- IPython >= 2.0
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Clawpack >= 5.1

To start the course, do

    git clone https://github.com/IanHawke/RiemannPython.git
    cd RiemannPython
    ipython notebook
    
and click on Lesson 0.

In case it isn't already clear enough, the material relies heavily on the motivation and examples of Ketcheson's [HyperPython](https://github.com/ketch/HyperPython) and Barba's [CFDPython](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython) and [AeroPython](https://github.com/barbagroup/AeroPython). Before using this material you should definitely study the HyperPython course, both for motivating examples and essential python coding skills.
